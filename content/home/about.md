I'm a PhD Candidate at the Economics Department, University College London. I've worked on a range of topics in health and labour economics. I'm committed to the use of data and reproducible analytical methods to evaluate policy and interventions -- in other words, to uncover _what works_. You can find my Curriculum Vitae [here](files/cv.pdf).
